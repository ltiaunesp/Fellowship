# Fellowship Project

Fellowship was inspired by the concept of Gamification, Scrum and Team Management. The main goal of this webapp is to have a tool that promotes project management, team organization, and skills quantification. With these features, Fellowship is a tool that provides better methods for the project manager to assign the perfect member to a job, as well as encourage all the workers to improve themselves.
